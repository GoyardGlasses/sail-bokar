## 🧠 Response Generation Logic

### 1. **Entity Extraction**
The chatbot extracts entities from user input:
- **Features** - Identifies which feature is being asked about
- **Routes** - Recognizes route names and variations
- **Materials** - Identifies material types
- **Topics** - Detects intent (risk, cost, timing, optimization, etc.)

### 2. **Context Awareness**
The chatbot maintains conversation context:
- Last route mentioned
- Last material discussed
- Last feature explored
- Number of questions asked
- Conversation history

### 3. **Dynamic Response Generation**
Based on entities and context, the chatbot generates:
- **Feature Navigation** - Guides to specific features with paths
- **Route Analysis** - Provides risk, cost, time, and reasoning
- **Material Recommendations** - Compares materials with analysis
- **Timing Advice** - Recommends best dispatch times
- **Optimization** - Suggests cost/safety improvements
- **Comparisons** - Compares routes or materials side-by-side
- **Help & Guidance** - Explains system capabilities

### 4. **Intelligent Fallback**
If the question doesn't match specific patterns:
- Uses conversation history to understand context
- Provides general information about the system
- Suggests related topics to explore
